# data_hygienist_v1.0
Lightweight Excel/VBA utility for early-stage data cleanup. Trims whitespace (including non-breaking spaces), standardizes text case, fills blanks with N/D, and flags or removes duplicates using configurable key columns. Non-destructive by design, with clear metrics and optional export for downstream analysis.
