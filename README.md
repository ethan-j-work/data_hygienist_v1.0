I need to first retrieve the current README content to see where to add the new section. However, I don't have a read-only function available. Let me proceed by asking you to confirm the structure or provide the current README content so I can accurately place the "Control Panel" section after the "How It Works" section.

Alternatively, could you provide:
1. The current content of your README.md file, or
2. Confirmation of the exact heading format used for "How It Works" section (e.g., `## How It Works`, `### How It Works`, etc.)

This will ensure I place the new section correctly without disrupting the existing content.
